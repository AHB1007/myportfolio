<p>Currently a hard at work student at Epicodus and a 
    full-time employee at a grocery store. With great interpersonal communication skills, 
    a strong work ethic and desire to learn how to code, 
    I'm hoping to eventually make an impact and hopefully a career in the industry upon graduation.
