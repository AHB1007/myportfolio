    <div class="my-class">
    Currently a hard at work student at Epicodus and a 
    full-time employee at a grocery store.  
    With a diverse background in online marketing, and great interpersonal communication skills, 
    a strong work ethic and desire to learn how to code, 
    I'm hoping to eventually make an impact and hopefully launch myself into a career within the industry upon graduation.

<h3>About Myself</h3>
<p>
    On my spare time I like to stay active, whether that is working out at the gym, snowboarding trips at Mt. Hood or going to do local photography. At home, 
    I am fully capable of watching TV and playing video games for extended periods of time. 
    
    <h4><i>I also really enjoy:</i><h4>
    
    <ul> 
        <li>Finding new local coffee shops throughout Portland!
        <li>Drinking quality craft beer at a good PNW brewery!</p>
